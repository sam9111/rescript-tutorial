/*
  Every individual `.res` file compiles into a module.

  A file named `hello.res` compiles to a module with the name `Hello`.

  You can put everything you've learned so far - bindings, expressions,
  control flow and functions within a ReScript module.

  The directory structure of your project has no effect on the name
  of a compiled module. Only the file name matters.

  There are no explicit import/export statements to bring a module
  into scope. After successful compilation of a project, every module
  is available for use anywhere within the project.

  Here is an example `hello.res`:

    ```
    let greet = name => `Hello, ${name}!`
    ```

  You can access the greet function from any other module like this:

    ```
    Hello.greet("visitor") // Hello, visitor!
    ```

  Modules can also be nested within a file. Here is an example:

/*
  There is some additional syntax here. The module definition is
  annotated with a type.

    ```
    module TheModuleName : TheModuleType =
      TheModuleImplementation
    ```

  This is the type definition for `GithubProject`:

    ```
    {
      type t = {
        name: string,
        url: string,
        repositories: int,
        people: int,
      }

      let linkTo: t => string
    }
    ```

  This is known as the interface of the module. Only those types
  and bindings defined in the interface will be publicly available
  for use in other modules.

  This interface defines the record type `t` and a function named
  `linkTo` which accepts this type `t` as input and returns a
  string.


  Everything defined inside the `GithubProject_WithoutInterface` module
  is public because it does not define its interface.

  Ideally you do not want to expose every implementation detail to
  the outside clients of the module. Instead you should think of the
  module interface as the API which the clients will use from
  other modules.

  Having an interface allows you to specify the constituents of that
  public API.

  The syntax you see here is only applicable for nested modules. So
  how do you add an interface for bindings, types and functions
  defined at the top level of a module?

  The answer is to create a separate interface file. This file has
  the extension `.resi`. The compiler understands that this is an
  interface and it only contains the type. It will look for the
  implementation of this interface in the `.res` file.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Exercise 2
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The `linkTo` function is part of the interface for the `GithubProject`
  module.

  Remove or comment out the implementation code for `linkTo` from within this
  module.

  This will result in a compilation error. Read the generated compiler error.

  It essentially tells you that the `linkTo` function is declared in the
  interface, but the compiler did not find it's impementation within the
  module.

  Reverse your changes to fix the compilation error, and proceed.

module Github_OT = GithubProject__OpaqueType

/*
  This module `Github_OT` declares an opaque type `t` in its interface.

  Earlier in `GithubProject` the full type was declared like:

    ```
    type t = {
      name: string,
      url: string,
      repositories: int,
      people: int,
    }
    ```

  Looking at this declaration you know that the type `t` is infact going
  to be a record in the implementation.

  Now you only have this in the interface:

    ```
    type t
    ```

  The implemenation is opaque. The type is opaque. From the point of view
  of the client there is no way to know that it is a record.

  This extends the idea of an API further where you hide not only your
  implementation but also data. You have heard of the phrase "data hiding".

  To update the `node` binding of type `GithubProject.t` you reached inside
  the record and immutably updated the implementation. The client knew how
  the type was implemented.

  This has the same issue as function bindings. If your type changes you
  will end up with changing code in a lot of places. Also this is your
  modules primary data structure. You do not want clients to depend on its
  impelmentation details.

  Later if you want to swap the implementation details to make it better -
  like faster, or more performant - all the call sites will also have to
  change. The change is not limited to only your module. All the clients
  have to change as well. That is not good design.

  ReScript modules provide you data encapsulation which cannot be broken
  by clients.

  use this function to immutably update the value. The client does not
  need to know the data type. So it cannot come to depend on the
