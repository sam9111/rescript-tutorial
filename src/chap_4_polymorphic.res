/*
  This type defines a pair of values both of which are of the same type.
  The `'a` is known as a type parameter or type variable. This means you
  can substitute `'a` with any type to create a `pair<'a>` type for that
  value.

  The type `pair<int>` represents a pair of `int` values.
  The type `pair<float>` represents a par of `float` values.

  You can have more than one type variable separated by a comma. For
  example,

    ```
    type triple<'a, 'b> = ('a, 'b, 'a)
    ```

  The `triple<'a, 'b>` is tuple with three values. The first and third
  values belong to type `'a` and the middle value must belong to the
  type `'b`.

  The type `triple<int, float>` is one of the many possible concrete
  manifestation of this type.

  Both `pair<'a>` and `triple<'a, 'b>` are generic or polymorphic types.
  The concrete type is substituted only when you create a value belonging
  to this type.

  This is also know as **parametric polymorphism**.

  Since the types are parametrized by type variables.

  Arrays are a polymorphic type data structure with the type `array<'a>`.
  The implication of this type is that all the values in an array must
  belong to the same type.

  This may not be something you explicitly consider in dynamic languages.
  Almost always you need the guarantee that values in the array have the
  same data structure or are the same type. Mixing and matching values
  of different types in an array are a source of bugs.

  For example you may be expecting float values in an array within a
  function. Every once in a while this results in a runtime error because
  you also get string values as input.

  There is no explicit notion of types in dynamic langauges. But the code
  which reads those values have an implict notion of the type of the value
  or rather its data structure.

  You can still write robust code in dynamic languages by making explicit
  the type or data structure values. You will not get a compiler to type
  check your code, but it is still better writing code where the types
  are implicit.

  The type of `Js.Array.reduce` is:

    ```
    let reduce: (('b, 'a) => 'b, 'b, array<'a>) => 'b
    ```

  Let us deconstruct the arguments one by one.

  This function has three input arguments,
    1. A reducer function
    2. An initial value for the accumulator
    3. The input array

  The output of the function is a single value which has the same type as
  the accumulator.

  In the above function the reducer (type annotated) function is,

    ```
    (acc: 'b, {count}: 'a): 'b => {
      acc + count
    }
    ```

  All it does is take destructure the `count` from the `metric` record
  value, and add it to the accumulator.

  The initial value of the accumulator is 0 (`'b`).

  The input has the type array<metric> (`array<'a>`).

  Let us trace the iterative execution:

    index | acc(input)  | {count} | (acc + count) returned
    ------------------------------------------------------
      [0] |         0   |    2342 |       0 + 2342 = 2342
      [1] |      2342   |     745 |    2342 +  745 = 3087
      [2] |      3087   |     385 |    3087 + 385  = 3472
      [3] |      3472   |     621 |    3472 + 621  = 4093
      [4] |      4093   |     111 |    4093 + 111  = 4204
      [5] |      4204   |     770 |    4204 + 770  = 4974
    ------------------------------------------------------

  At the end of the execution the value in the accumulator is returned.

  The `reduce` function took an `array<metric>` values and aggregated it
  into a `int` value.

  The initial value for an accumulator depends on the type and operation
  being peformed. If you were multiplying the initial value of the
  accumulator should be `1`. If it was `0`, then the result returned
  will also be zero because of multiplication with zero.

  If the accumulator is a string type value, and you were concatenating
  string values, then the initial value could be an empty string.

  The initial value should be considered carefully depending on the type
  of aggregation you want to perform.

  Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake - Tony Hoare
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The null reference was invented in 1965 in the Algol W language designed by
  Tony Hoare & Niklaus Wirth.

  Historically this turned out to be a bad idea. The programming languages
  which came later adopted the same design. It led to numerous errors in
  programming, and easily exploitable vulnerabilities in software.

  After 40 years since the invention Hoare estimates the problems caused by
  null references would exceed a billion dollars.

  This goes on to also show the difficulty of programming languge design.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Earlier it was mentioned that the JS API would raise expcetions when it
  enters invalid states. But the Belt API does not raise any exceptions.

  You cannot know through the type that a function will raise an exception.
  It is something you can know only at runtime. But with experience you
  will notice that certain APIs have to raise an exception. For example
  you want to get an array value at a certain index. The API you design
  would be to get the array, and the index as input and return the value
  at that index.

  The edge case is when you get an invalid index. How should your function
  behave in this situation? Do you return null? Do you raise a runtime
  exception? These are your choices.

  ReScript does not have either `null` or `undefined` values which are
  available in JavaScript.

  But the idea of a value which does not exist is useful thing to express
  in code. It would be even better if this could be captured by the type
  system.

  The solution we have in ReScript is the `option<'a>` type.

    ```
    type option<'a> = None | Some<'a>
    ```

  It is a variant with two constructors. The `None` constructor represents
  idea of nothing, or no value is present. The `Some<'a>` represents a
  value which is available.

  The type signature for the array function to get a value at an index
  can then be encoded in the type like this:

    ```
    let arrayGet: (array<'a>, int) => option<'a>
    ```

  When you see function type signatures which returns an `option<'a>`
  value, it is immediately understood that the API may not always be
  able to return a valid value for all possible inputs.

  This is much better approach than the default of having to raise
  exceptions. It is also not good program design to use exceptions for
  control flow.

/*
  The `userInputToKey` function takes keyboard input and maps it to

    ```
    let userInputToKey: string => option<key>

  The underscore pattern-match is to ignore any string input we do
  not care about. It is alright to use this with an infinite sequence
  like string values. But using the underscore pattern-match syntax
  with a variant you lose the benefit of exhaustive case-analysis.

  If you have the underscore pattern-match in your function and later
  you add a new case, the compiler will skip this function. And this
  could hide a defect. So do not use it with pattern-matching for
  variants.

It could mean derision, mockery, isolation.
Isolation is the gift.
All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it.
And, you’ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds.
And it will be better than anything else you can imagine.
If you’re going to try, go all the way.

You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It’s the only good fight there is`

  Earlier we used `map` for arrays & list values. An input function was iteratively
  applied to each value. The newly minted values are then returned a new array or
  list.

  Similarly we can use `map` for the option type. An option has two possible values.
  Either there is a value: `Some(x)` or there is nothing: `None`.

  When you write a function to operate on an option type value, it is natural to
  pattern match on option. But if you needed the same functionality for a non-option
  value, you would have to rewrite the same function again. Let us see how this
  can be avoided with the following example.

  The `repeatTwice` takes an `option<string>` and returns an `option<string>`. Given
  an `array<option<string>>` values we can use `Belt.Array.map` to create a new
  array where the messages are repeated twice, and the `None` values are left as
  they are.

/*
  The `repeatTwiceZeroKnowledge` function does not pattern match an option
  value. It is a regular `string => string` function.

  The `Belt.Option.map` function can take this function as input. The `map`
  function invokes the function only when there is `Some(text)` value. The
  function is not invoked for `None` values.

  If you look at the implementation of `repeatTwice` above, this is exactly
  what is written there. The None value passes through without any further
  computation. Only `Some(text)` invokes the repeat function.

  The `Belt.Option.map` takes the value returned by `repeatTwiceZeroKnowledge`
  and wraps it in `Some(returnedValue)`.

    ```
    // Some("hellohello")
    Some("hello")->Belt.Option.map(repeatTwiceZeroKnowledge)

    // None
    None->Belt.Option.map(repeatTwiceZeroKnowledge)
    ```
